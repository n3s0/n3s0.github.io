Friend of mine pushed in my direction a blog maintained by Chris
Siebenmann. Specifically post(s) that involve what the University of
Toronto calls "worklogs". These are change logs on a server for each
server. That get emailed and archived. Later to be viewed by your peers.

Depending on the culture of the work place. This can be a benefit.
Though it may not. Quite a few factors play into it. Chris discusses the
benefits in one of his articles; listed below, and it makes sense. There
are some work places where wearing many hats can be a blessing and a
curse. Curse especially if there are poor documentation habits. Yes, I'm
talking about the people who write "work is done" in their ticket. 

- [My theory on why worklogs work for us](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/WhyWorklogsWorkForUs)

There may be multiple ways to do this effectively. Maybe instead of
sending an email of everything you did to a server. Perhaps you have the
worklog on the server that gets updated when work is done via a script
that records what you do. That then is automagically pushed to a
centralized server where all of the worklogs are stored. Doesn't
necessarily have to be web based. It's just a different way of
thinking. The ```grep(1)``` command can be used to search for the data.

I'll noodle my thoughts a little here.
