## Summary

This post contains some notes from one of my lab server setups. In this
particular lab I was exploring adding a separate disk for production
critical application data hosted on a server. In this case. It's a web
server. So, the wwwroot would have it's own disk.

Note that this post is mostly geared towards environments that hosts
machines in virtual environments. Though, we can also have the same
benefit for adding an extra physical disk to a server. It's virtually
(no pun intended) the same concept.

Separating production applications and their data into separate
partitions or disks can have the following benefits. These are some of
the ones that I've thought of or have observed. There are definitely
more benefits to this.

1. Makes it easier to expand the disk/partition in VMs.
2. Can make it simpler to migrate disks to different servers.
3. If you adhere to the base OS with minor changes. It can allow you to
   isolate which disks on the machine you backup.

This is a configuration concept for web servers that I've just recently
started exploring after a friend discussed it with me. I'll discuss the
concepts in a later post. Then link to that post below.

## Hardware Additions

Some hardware additions will need to be explained to provide more
context within this article. The system I'm working on is an LVM volume
group named vg00. I need to add a different disk so the web server is
separated into a different partition.

I am adding a new disk that is 16 GB in size to hold all of the web
applications static content provided by perspective users.

The volume label will be vg00-wwwroot and will be mounted on the
path /til/wwwroot.

Powered off the VM and added a new disk that was 16 GB in size and
powered it back up again.

### Initial Disk Configuration

First needed to check to see which drive sdX drive the system was going
to be configured. To do this, I listed all of the available disks using
fdisk and the -l flag. This will list the disks and partitions on the
system.

```sh
fdisk -l
```

Provided below is the output from the command above.

Looks like the disk path is /dev/sdb. It's 16 GB in size so that must be
the disk that needs to be configured.

```sh
Disk /dev/sdb: 16 GiB, 17179869184 bytes, 33554432 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```



```sh
fdisk /dev/sdb
```

```sh
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.32.1).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

```

## Creating The Physical Volume

```sh
pvcreate /dev/sdb1
```
```sh
  Physical volume "/dev/sdb1" successfully created.
```

## Extending The vg00 Volume Group

When 

```sh
vgextend vg00 /dev/sdb1
```
```sh
  Volume group "vg00" successfully extended
```

```sh
vgdisplay
```


```sh
  --- Volume group ---
  VG Name               vg00
  System ID             
  Format                lvm2

  Total PE              15869
  Alloc PE / Size       11774 / 45.99 GiB
  Free  PE / Size       4095 / <16.00 GiB
  VG UUID               1jl4if-3NMn-I53T-Iori-Rdbv-e5Oi-hgum2E
```

```sh
lvcreate -n wwwroot -l 4095 vg00
```
```sh
  Logical volume "wwwroot" created.
```

Using the lvdisplay(1) command I list the logical volumes on the system
to confirm that it's been configured.

```sh
lvdisplay
```

Below is the output of the command. It confirms 

```sh
--- Logical volume ---
  LV Path                /dev/vg00/wwwroot
  LV Name                wwwroot

```sh

Discarding blocks...Done.

```

```sh
mkdir -p /til/wwwroot
```

```sh
mount /dev/vg00/wwwroot /til/wwwroot
```

Add the following line to the /etc/fstab.

```sh
/dev/mapper/vg00-wwwroot /til/wwwroot           xfs     defaults        0 0
```

After rebooting the server. Used the df(1) command to review the current
partition layout.

```sh
df -h
```

Based on the output below. It looks like the wwwroot partition has been
mounted through fstab(1). I can now continue to configure the server and
deploy the application.

```sh
Filesystem                Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs                  825M     0  825M   0% /dev

## Conclusion

Though these are merely notes of me playing with LVM. This could prove
useful in the future. Soon I may go through partitioning in other
applications. It's useful to go back to basics and discuss them.
Considering that there are GUI applications that will do a lot of the
work for you.
