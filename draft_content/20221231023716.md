## Summary


## Infrastructure

Infrastructure is a little different then the usual setup I perform.
Actual components are going to be on a web server and a separate
database server as opposed to both the application and the server
going on the same host.

- tl-www-02:
+--  3 lines: - Name: lab-www-02-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- tl-db-02:
+--  3 lines: - Name: lab-db-02------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Before We Begin

Before beginning the setup of the application. A baseline configuration
for the servers needs to be set. Please perform your baseline before
beginning the installation.

## Database Install & Config

Database is going to be setup first on tl-db-02. Need to install
PostgresSQL and its dependencies first.

```sh
apt update
```
```
apt install -y postgresql
```
```
systemctl enable postgresql
```
```
systemctl start postgresql
```
```
psql -V
```
```
psql (PostgreSQL) 14.5 (Ubuntu 14.5-0ubuntu0.22.04.1)
```
```
sudo -u postgres psql
```

```
CREATE DATABASE netbox;
```
```
CREATE USER netbox WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```
```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE netbox TO netbox;
```

Should be able to access the server from localhost because it's allowed by default.

```
psql --username netbox --password --host localhost --dbname=netbox
```

Should login after the password is entered.

Then we need to add the configuration that allows the server to be accessible from
the web server.

First needed to edit the /etc/postgresql/14/main/postgresql.conf file and edit the listening address.

```

```

then need to edit the /etc/postgresql/14/main/pg_hba.conf and add the following in the IPv4 allow list.
To those following along. You'll need to replace the IP address placed in here with the one of your
web server.

```

```

then restart the service.

```sh
systemctl restart postgresql
```

Should be able to connect from the web server after installing the postgresql-client package.

Command for installing the postgresql-client package.

```sh
apt install -y postgresql-client
```

command for connecting the database.

```sh
psql --username netbox --password --host 172.27.127.31 --dbname=netbox
```

## Redis Installation

I decided to install redis on the web server because the size of the
environment doesn't require anything too special. This isn't going to
be a very big deployment. But, if there's an available redis server
on the network already and there are no objections to having them
co-habitate. It should probably go on that. Just going to need to
be mindful of the firewall rules on the host should filtering be a
little more strict. It's all dependent on the environment requirements
of the deployment.

Netbox will be the only use for this Redis server. So, I will go for
a little less for Redis. I'll show some of the things to watch out for
that consists of some basic setup. Along with adding a little security
just so I don't have any application that can do anything with my Redis
data.

Defaults for Redis are wide open generally.
```
apt install -y redis-server
```
```
redis-cli -V
```
```
Redis server v=6.0.16 sha=00000000:0 malloc=jemalloc-5.2.1 bits=64 build=a3fdef44459b3ad6
```
```
redis-cli ping
```
```
PONG
```

Now that I've confirmed it's working. I'm going to make an effort to make
Redis more secure.

```
################################## NETWORK #####################################

# By default, if no "bind" configuration directive is specified, Redis listens
# for connections from all available network interfaces on the host machine.
# It is possible to listen to just one or multiple selected interfaces using
# the "bind" configuration directive, followed by one or more IP addresses.
#
# Examples:
#
# bind 192.168.1.100 10.0.0.1
# bind 127.0.0.1 ::1
#
# ~~~ WARNING ~~~ If the computer running Redis is directly exposed to the
# internet, binding to all the interfaces is dangerous and will expose the
# instance to everybody on the internet. So by default we uncomment the
# following bind directive, that will force Redis to listen only on the
# IPv4 loopback interface address (this means Redis will only be able to
# accept client connections from the same host that it is running on).
#
# IF YOU ARE SURE YOU WANT YOUR INSTANCE TO LISTEN TO ALL THE INTERFACES
# JUST COMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING LINE.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
bind 127.0.0.1
```

```
# Protected mode is a layer of security protection, in order to avoid that
# Redis instances left open on the internet are accessed and exploited.
#
# When protected mode is on and if:
#
# 1) The server is not binding explicitly to a set of addresses using the
#    "bind" directive.
# 2) No password is configured.
#
# The server only accepts connections from clients connecting from the
# IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and from Unix domain
# sockets.
#
# By default protected mode is enabled. You should disable it only if
# you are sure you want clients from other hosts to connect to Redis
# even if no authentication is configured, nor a specific set of interfaces
# are explicitly listed using the "bind" directive.
protected-mode yes
```

```
# By default Redis does not run as a daemon. Use 'yes' if you need it.
# Note that Redis will write a pid file in /var/run/redis.pid when daemonized.
daemonize yes
```

```
# Specify the server verbosity level.
# This can be one of:
# debug (a lot of information, useful for development/testing)
# verbose (many rarely useful info, but not a mess like the debug level)
# notice (moderately verbose, what you want in production probably)
# warning (only very important / critical messages are logged)
loglevel notice
```
```
# Specify the log file name. Also the empty string can be used to force
# Redis to log on the standard output. Note that if you use standard
# output for logging but daemonize, logs will be sent to /dev/null
logfile /var/log/redis/redis-server.log
```

Wont be configuring replication on the server. So, there is no need to
configure the master/slave bits.

If the ```requirepass``` configuration option is set by default. The
```default``` user will need to authenticate with a password.

```
# IMPORTANT NOTE: starting with Redis 6 "requirepass" is just a compatibility
# layer on top of the new ACL system. The option effect will be just setting
# the password for the default user. Clients will still authenticate using
# AUTH <password> as usually, or more explicitly with AUTH default <password>
# if they follow the new protocol: both will work.
#
requirepass "secure password"
```

## Netbox Installation

First step is to install the required packages using the ```apt``` command.

```sh
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv python3-dev build-essential libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libffi-dev libpq-dev libssl-dev zlib1g-dev
```

Git will be required for this installation. If it's not installed already
the following command will install it.

```sh
sudo apt install -y git
```

Create a system user and group for Netbox. This will be used to set
permissions for the ```/media/``` directory for the application.

```sh
adduser --system --group netbox
```

In this installation. I'm using the clone method provided by the
documentation provided by Netbox. It's cloning the latest stable version
into the ```/opt/netbox``` directory on the server.

```sh
git clone -b master --depth 1 https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox.git /opt/netbox
```

Change the ownership to the netbox user and group on the directory path
```/opt/netbox/netbox/media/```.

```sh
sudo chown --recursive netbox /opt/netbox/netbox/media/
```

Copy the ```configuration_example.py``` file in the ```/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox```
directory as ```configuration.py``` in the same directory. This will be
the configuration file for the application.

```sh
cp /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration_example.py /opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py
```

Edit the ```/opt/netbox/netbox/netbox/configuration.py``` file. There
will be a few configuration changes to the file after copying the example
to the one that's required by application.

Set the allowed hosts to the server_name - I'll get to it later - from
the Nginx configuration and the private IP address of the server. In this
case I'm using ```dcim.lab.loftus``` and ```192.168.0.50```. With the
IP address. It's worth noting this is dependant on the IP address of the
server. It can also go away when testing is done.

These names will be proxied from the Nginx server to the Gunicorn server
and later back to the user.

```
# This is a list of valid fully-qualified domain names (FQDNs) for the NetBox server. NetBox will not permit write
# access to the server via any other hostnames. The first FQDN in the list will be treated as the preferred name.
#
# Example: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['netbox.example.com', 'netbox.internal.local']
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['dcim.lab.loftus', '192.168.0.50']
```

Then it's the configuration for PostgreSQL. In this case I'm configuring
this so the queries go to another server on the same network. So, I add
the IP address of the server to the configuration to the ```'HOST'```
configuration. The comments are pretty descriptive.

Of course, no one is recommended to put the password available in the
configuration file I have displayed as the one configured for the
PostgreSQL server or the one in the configuration file.

```
# PostgreSQL database configuration. See the Django documentation for a complete list of available parameters:
#   https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#databases
DATABASE = {
+--  6 lines: 'NAME': 'netbox',               # Database name------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
}
```

```
# Redis database settings. Redis is used for caching and for queuing background tasks such as webhook events. A separate
# configuration exists for each. Full connection details are required in both sections, and it is strongly recommended
# to use two separate database IDs.
REDIS = {
+-- 26 lines: 'tasks': {-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
}
```

Time to generate the secret key for the server. This will be different
per installation because this is randomly generated.

```sh
python3 generate_secret_key.py
```

Below is the output generated from the ```generate_secret_key.py```
script. It will be used in this configuration file and should be different
for every installation of Netbox.

```sh
0aeJUu6X)h9+#vForuHAXTsHoAJyIQEJ9yZJg0@(dc80gqM9gd
```

This will be changed for production. But, here we are. Configuring the
secret key for the netbox installation that was just created.

```
# This key is used for secure generation of random numbers and strings. It must never be exposed outside of this file.
# For optimal security, SECRET_KEY should be at least 50 characters in length and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and
# symbols. NetBox will not run without this defined. For more information, see
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY
SECRET_KEY = '0aeJUu6X)h9+#vForuHAXTsHoAJyIQEJ9yZJg0@(dc80gqM9gd'
```

The following command is used to install and upgrade the server.


```sh
/opt/netbox/upgrade.sh
```

## Setting Up Gunicorn for Netbox Services

This section goes through setting up the Gunicorn service.

```
sudo cp /opt/netbox/contrib/gunicorn.py /opt/netbox/gunicorn.py
```

```
sudo cp /opt/netbox/contrib/*.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

The following

```
sudo systemctl enable netbox netbox-rq
```
```
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/netbox.service → /etc/systemd/system/netbox.service.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/netbox-rq.service → /etc/systemd/system/netbox-rq.service.
```

```sh
sudo systemctl start netbox netbox-rq
```

```sh
systemctl status netbox.service
```

## Installing and Setting Up Nginx

First the web server needs to be installed. I'm going to install Nginx.
The command can be found below. After running it. Nginx will be installed.

```sh
apt install -y nginx
```
Need to copy the default

```
cp /opt/netbox/contrib/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox
```

Need to disable the default site so it's not serving the default web
page. This can be enabled later for testing. But, because right now
there isn't any need for it. It doesn't need to be disabled.

```sh
rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

### Non-Production Friendly Nginx Config

With copying the Nginx configuration provided by the netbox installation
workstation I decided to at least get it to work on http. Won't configure
https until I get it working how I want it.

```
server {
+-- 15 lines: listen 80;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
}
```
### Production Friendly Nginx Config

I will soon include a portion that provides more production friendly or
something that will provide at least a simulation of a production friendly
Nginx configuration.

### Finishing Up & Testing

Gotta make sure I test the Nginx configuration. Just so we know.

```
nginx -t
```

Output indicates that the configuration files are OK. Moving on.

```
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

Now that the configuration looks good. Time to

```
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/netbox /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/netbox
```

Need to restart the nginx service so the working configuration does its
job.

```
systemctl restart nginx
```

## Conclusion



## Troubleshooting

Considering this is a setup that works for multiple servers there are
aspects of troubleshooting needed just in case stuff doesn't work.

If you utilize default deny outbound/inbound/routed policies in UFW.
You'll need to allow the ports the netbox app requires for the app/web
server and the database server.

### Firewall Rules (If Applicable)

Should some basic ports be needed for this. The following artitcle can
be referenced for this. Over time this will be updated. But, for
simplicity it's what I have. Allows all of the ports needed for remote
management of the server. Along with updates.

- []()

Both server will need to have the following rules so they're accessible
for SSH. These rules will need to be configured on both servers. It's
touched on in the article provided above. But, here you go. Just in case
it's needed.

The command below will allow SSH access to the server. So, access is
available from any where. This can be tweaked also so it includes the
local subnet the server is hosted on. Just depends on the fancy.

```sh
ufw allow in 22/tcp
```

The command below will allow SSH access out of the server. So, if
connecting to the database server was needed or the other way around.
You can do so.
```sh
ufw allow out 22/tcp
```

For the web server the following rules will need to be added to allow
traffic outbound/inbound.

```
ufw allow in 80/tcp
```
```
ufw allow in 443/tcp
```
```
ufw allow out 5432/tcp
```

For the web server the following rules will need to be added to allow
traffic outbound/inbound.

```
ufw allow in 5432/tcp
```

Now of course if you don't have this configuration. You'll just want to
allow the inbound stuff if allowing outbound traffic but blocking inbound
by default.

### The upgrade.sh Failure To Install On First Run

Sometimes the upgrade will fail to install upon first run. Not saying this
will always happen. But, it happened to me when I initially ran the upgrade.sh
script. Rerunning the script again fixed the issue.

```
sudo /opt/netbox/upgrade.sh
```
