## Overview

Another programming assignment that I found on ```r/learnpython```. 
Looks like the OP needs help with a Python assignment. There hasn't 
been much traction on it. It's about two months old. So, it should 
be fair game! Let's go!

## Assignment

Below is the assignment.

hey guys! I need help with this: how do you use python to print a 
program that prints out a list from 1-6,4 times and have one gap 
between each list and it is vertical.

Below is their desired output based on the OP's comment. Where is the 
gap between each list? Though, this is not what they explained. So, I 
am going to do both. The requirements from their explaination. Then, 
I will do it from the expected output.

```sh
1

```

## Solutions

### Solution 1 - As Explained

This is the solution to the problem the OP provided. As explained.

1. It lists 1-6 four times.
2. It has one gap between each list.
3. It's vertical. 

#### Code

Using a ```for()``` loop to iterate between the numbers one through 
four using ```range()```. Nested another ```for()``` loop within it and 
iterated though one and seven. Printed the number it's on. Printed an 
empty line after the nested iteration was completed.

This continues until the range of the parent loop reaches the the end. In 
this case it's four. So, when it hits five. The operation stops.

This can be done with```while()``` loops too. I'll update this post
later.

The solution that I came up with for this.

"""

# Iterate through the range 1 through 4 and assign each
# value to the variable counter. 
for counter in range(1, 5):
    # iterate through 1 and 6 and assign each value to the
    # the variable number
    for number in range(1, 7):
	# print the number
        print(number)
    # print the gap requested.
    print()

```

#### Output

Output can be seen below and it looks like we have the desired outcome.

```sh
python homework.py
1
2
3
4

```

## Solution 2 - Expected Output

This provides the solution for the output they were expecting.

### Code

It's the same code. Only it doesn't print a new line after the six.

```python
