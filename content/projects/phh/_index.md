## Summary
---

Sometimes I enjoy going online to look for code I may be experienced 
enough to help review and fix. Should that be a Computer Science student
that doesn't understand the assignment or someone needs help with an error.

If I can work through the problem, I will assist them. But, I generally like
to show my work too. So, I post it online within a week or so just so 
if it's an assignment they need to do. They don't get flagged for cheating.

Another thing I'll do is write up one of these after they provide the
description of their issue and I'll post it on the forum. Rather then 
copy and paste the code with an explaination.
