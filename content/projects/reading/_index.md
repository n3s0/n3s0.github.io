## Summary
---

This is a little place on the Internet where I talk about books I'm reading.
I'll be discussing books I want to read, currently reading, and what I've 
finished. I intend on providing an update every quarter with the books I've read
and the ones I'm currently ingesting. Of course, consistancy may vary. I'll set
a calendar reminder for it.
