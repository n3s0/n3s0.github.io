## Summary

I haven't done a whole lot with exploit exercises. I didn't know they moved sites and
domains until now. But, I'm thinking about picking up where I left off.

Below is the initial website for expoit education. Which is the new name for Exploit
Exercises. But, I've also provided links to the old sites with other methods to obtain
the VMs. You never know when they might rebrand again.

- [Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/)

Exploit Exercises has been cached on Vulnhub  also. Just in case the site is down.

- [Vulnhub - Exploit Exercises](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/exploit-exercises,11/)

If anyone would like to see the site on the Wayback Machine. Here is the site.

Below is a list of the VMs that are offered through the site. I have linked to the ones that I'm doing currently
or have in progress.

1. Phoenix
2. [Nebula](https://exploit.education/nebula/)
3. Fusion
4. Main Sequence
5. Protostar

## Exploit Exercises Introduction

exploit.education provides a variety of virtual machines, documentation and challenges that can be used to learn about a variety of computer security issues such as privilege escalation, vulnerability analysis, exploit development, debugging, reverse engineering, and general cyber security issues.

Below is a list of the in progress or completed VMs. (Some stuff still needs to be uploaded.)
