## Summary
---

This is a list of all of the solutions I've completed for the Over The 
Wire - Bandit wargame. This was completed while I was in college. So it's
probably ready for a do over just to see how well it aged.

The thing I enjoyed about this one is how well it flowed together. It was
excellent for anyone who needs to kill a couple hours and spend time 
researching new skills or polishing old ones.

Below is a link to the Bandit challenge.

## Bandit Introductions
---

The Bandit wargame is aimed at absolute beginners. It will teach the 
basics needed to be able to play other wargames. If you notice something 
essential is missing or have ideas for new levels, please let us know!

## Note for beginners
---

This game, like most other games, is organized in levels. You start at 
Level 0 and try to “beat” or “finish” it. Finishing a level results in 
information on how to start the next level. The pages on this website 
for “Level ” contain information on how to start level X from the 
previous level. E.g. The page for Level 1 has information on how to 
gain access from Level 0 to Level 1. All levels in this game have a page 
on this website, and they are all linked to from the sidemenu on the left 
of this page.

You will encounter many situations in which you have no idea what you 
are supposed to do. Don’t panic! Don’t give up! The purpose of this game 
is for you to learn the basics. Part of learning the basics, is reading 
a lot of new information.

There are several things you can try when you are unsure how to continue:

First, if you know a command, but don’t know how to use it, try the 
manual (man page) by entering “man ” (without the quotes). e.g. if you 
know about the “ls” command, type: man ls. The “man” command also has a 
manual, try it. Press q to quit the man command. Second, if there is no 
man page, the command might be a shell built-in. In that case use the 
“help ” command. E.g. help cd Also, your favorite search-engine is your 
friend. Learn how to use it! I recommend Google. Lastly, if you are still 
stuck, you can join us on IRC You’re ready to start! Begin with Level 
0, linked at the left of this page. Good luck!
