Over The Wire is a handfull of separate Wargames or challenges built to
test your skills. Most of my exposure with it is Bandit. It does a good
job of being diverse and challenging. But, this page is for all of the
Wargames. I finished Bandit in college. But, I didn't document the full
experience. Though I wish I would have.

So, I'm going to go through Bandit and the others a little more as time
goes on.

There are about thirteen wargames alone on the site. Mostly online
online challenges. But, there is also one online challenge.

A list of the online challenges can be found below.

- [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)
- Natas
- Leviathan
- Krypton
- Narnia
- Behemoth
- Utumno
- Maze
- Vortex
- Manpage
- Drifter
- FormulaOne

The list of offline wargames can be found below.

- Semtex 

There is a suggested order to do your run through of the wargames.
I've included them in the introduction provided in the site.

If anyone would like to use this to challenge themselves. Below is the 
link.

Okay, I'm back. One thing that I forgot to mention is I will be redacting
the passwords for these wargames. With the exception of the initial one.
