## Overview

### Task 1 - Intro

This room is the first part in the Linux Fundamental rooms designed to 
teach you about various Linux concepts, and in-built tools. This room 
covers the following topics:

- Introduction To Linux
- Executing Commands and Man Pages
- Basic File Operators

If you want to SSH into the machine, connect to our network and use the 
following SSH login credentials:
    Username: shiba1
    Password: shiba1

Logging into a machine via SSH is covered in the Linux Fundamentals 2 room.

### Task 2 - Methodology

After careful consideration, I've deemed the best way to go about this 
is to introduce various concepts in sections, with each section being 
more complex and requiring knowledge from the previous section. To better 
enable the transition between section, I've split each section into 
different users in the VM; when you finish a section you'll have to complete 
a challenge and then you'll be able to move onto the next section.
