## Summary
---

This is a little baseline I have for deploying Ubuntu Servers. Something I use 
from time to time as a checklist to make sure I have some essential tools and 
configuration needed. A lot of the stuff in this list can range anywhere between 
updates, firewall configuration, SSH keys, etc.

This baseline will be updated as I find new things to add to it.

## Updates
---

Need to keep the server up to date. One of those essentials for day-to-day
administration of our systems. Regardless of how many issues may come about
their application. It's a standard belief of mine that updating these systems is
for a betterment as far as operation and security is concerned.

Generally with Ubuntu I have rarely seen an update break an application that I 
installed. 

Update package repositories.

```sh
apt update
```

Upgrade packages.

```sh
apt upgrade -y
```

Sometimes we need to ask Ubuntu to cleanup old packages for us.

```sh
apt autoremove -y
```

## Some Personal Touches
---

Just some things I do as personal touches to servers I deploy so they’re more familiar and have the tools I need.

### Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
---

```sh
apt install vim nmap htop tcpdump sysstat
```

## SSH
---

### Generate New Host Keys
---

Generating new host keys for SSH can be a good baseline for new servers. I generally do this upon a fresh installation.

Remove the host keys generated by the system.

```sh
rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
```

Then generate the RSA keys.

```sh
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key -N '' -q -t rsa
```

Generate the ECDSA keys.

```sh
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key -N '' -q -t ecdsa
```

Generate the ed25519 keys.

```sh
ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key -N '' -q -t ed25519
```

Restart the SSH service.

```sh
systemctl restart sshd
```

If doing this from an SSH prompt. It will be prudent to remove the key from known_hosts as well using the following command from the client computer.

```sh
ssh-keygen -R "<hostname/ip>"
```

### Configure the SSH Server
---

Some little things that need to be performed to make it so the ssh server is configured appropriately. Added will be a little 99-company/99-.

File is generally put in the sshd_config directory.

- /etc/sshd/sshd_config.d/99-n3s0.conf

The configuration below may change frequently. But, this is generally the baseline.

```sh
Port 22
AddressFamily inet

HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key

SyslogFacility AUTH
LogLevel INFO

PasswordAuthentication yes
PermitEmptyPasswords no
PermitRootLogin no

DenyUsers root
AllowUsers <users>
```

## Generate Keys for All Users
---

Need to generate or import the appropriate SSH keys for all users. This is especially for the root user.

Run the following command on the root user account. Also make sure to instruct or login then run the following command to generate the keys for the users.

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

## Completing SSH Configuration Changes
---

To check the ssh configuration. The following command can be entered.

```sh
sshd -t
```

Once this is complete. SSH server should be restarted.

```sh
systemctl restart sshd
```

## Disable Cloud-Init (If not used)
---

If cloud-init isn’t being used. I disable it.

Since I have an article for doing this already. Below is the link to that article.

- [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS: Disable & Remove Cloud-Init](#)

The server will need to be rebooted after adding this file.

## Firewall
---

I generally stick with UFW for Ubuntu Servers just for it’s ease of use.

## Enable UFW
---

These commands should be entered using either sudo(1) or as the root user.

UFW is in an inactive state by default. To confirm the status can be checked.

```sh
ufw status
```

Below is the output of the command if UFW is inactive.

```sh
Status: inactive
```

Enable UFW using the command below.

```sh
ufw enable
```

Check the status for UFW to confirm it’s active.

```sh
ufw status
```

The desired output can be found below.

```sh
Status: active
```

## UFW (Strict)
---

Then I decide to disable the use of IPv6 because I’m not necessarily ready to go that route. Some day. But, not now.

To do this I edit the /etc/default/ufw file on the following line and reload ufw.

```sh
# Set to yes to apply rules to support IPv6 (no means only IPv6 on loopback
# accepted). You will need to 'disable' and then 'enable' the firewall for
# the changes to take affect.
IPV6=no
```

The command below will reload UFW.

```sh
ufw reload
```

Allow SSH in on the server.

```sh
ufw allow in 22/tcp
```

Since we're performing a strict configuration. We'll need to allow the services
we need outbound because we are setting an implicit deny outbound. Generally it's
good to get these in place before we decide to deny all ingress and egress traffic.

```sh
ufw allow out 123/udp 
ufw allow out 80/tcp 
ufw allow out 443/tcp 
ufw allow out 53
```

Denies all incomming traffice.

```sh
ufw default deny incoming
```

Denies all outgoing traffic.

```sh
ufw default deny outgoing
```

Denies routing.

```sh
ufw default deny routed
```

Once all of this is configured. I reload ufw.

```sh
ufw reload
```

## UFW (Less Strict)
---

Provided is configuration for environments where implicit deny isn’t necessarily needed on hosts. If it’s internal or where values regarding security aren’t necessarily that large.
