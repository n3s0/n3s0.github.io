This provides the writeups for the Sad Servers challenges. Which is a
a site where people generate real world scenarios to for others to debug
and fix. Helping everyone improve their skills.

The site provides a range of challenges between Easy, Medium, and Hard.
I normally focus more on the Do and Fix challenge types. But, there is
also a Hack challenge type. But, it's pretty diverse over all. Even if
these are just Linux challenges. 

You can have anywhere between a database to fix/recover, fixing web 
server issues, renewing TLS certificates, Bash scripting, Docker 
troubleshooting, DNS troubleshooting, and much more. It just depends on 
how deep you want to go down the rabbit hole. It's hard to get bored.

If anyone would also like to work through these. Here is the link.
