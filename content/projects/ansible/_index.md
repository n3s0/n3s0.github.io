## Summary
---

I've been in the market for finding new ways to automate workflows and learn 
different automation tools. Ansible is a reasonable choice for this because; for
now, it's still free to use.

This is my documentation for these playbooks. Consolidated into one page I will 
provide my reasoning and use of the playbooks.

## Caution
---

Before you use this. Please make sure you understand what it does before you use it. 
Your environments are your responsibility. So, read the documentation and read the 
source.
