Now this is a PowerShell spinoff of Over The Wire. Which I love.
The challenges give you some basics along with a taste of performing
some tasks in Active Directory with PowerShell. Which I think is what
most sysadmins should be proficient in. Clicking is great. But, as far
as automation is concerned. PowerShell takes the cake.

If anyone wants to dive right into the wargames here is the link.

## General Notes:
---

All of the games are listed on the side menu. All levels within each game have a page on this website and are linked from each game. Each level contains a task or challenge and the solution is the password for the following level. All usernames contain the name of the game and the level number (ex: for Century, it would be century1, century2, etc… and for Trebek, it would be trebek1, trebek2, etc…). Once you feel you have completed a challenge, start a new connection to the server, and log in with the next user and the password you gained from the previous challenge. If successful, close out the previous connection and begin to solve the current challenge. This concept is repeated over and over until you reach the end of the game. You will be using either SSH or PSRemoting to connect to our game servers.

It’s not expected for anyone to know everything they will encounter in this game, so please don’t panic, as the purpose of these games are to learn.

All passwords are lowercase regardless of how they may appear on the screen.

Some things that may help you in the games are below.

- The Internet
- Get-Help
- Get-Command
- Get-Member
- The “Tab” key will help with finishing out commands

Below is the list of noted wargames. Completed and in progress.
