I write and manage this site by myself in my spare time so I have references and
information in the future. Though I am sharing this with everyone in the event
that it benefits anyone. If you feel this website has provided value to you. I 
humbly ask that you offer you your support through the options preseted below.

I would also like to mention I am also open to work related to the things I
post. If there is need for assistance with troubleshooting, I will be happy to
provide my skillsets within reason.

At this time I'm only accepting support through Buy Me A Coffee. But, in the 
future I will focus on adding cryptocurrency options.
