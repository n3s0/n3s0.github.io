I've been meaning to start this for a long time. Just a folder full of
configuration and performance baselines. Coupled with notes on how to 
initally prep our favorite OSs on our favorite platforms.

Standards are good to have available especially if you don't work with
one OS for a while. Coming back to something like this has been good for
me.

If anyone has an idea. Please let me know and I'll work through getting
it posted.
