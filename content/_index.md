n3s0 || journal is a place where I share my thoughts on a wide variety 
of topics. The entries are complimented by notes and projects or they're
just something I thought I'd talk about.

My interests very between networking, coding, sysadmin, etc. to watches,
firearms, hiking, jiu jitsu, travel, books etc. As long as I have the ability
and the opportunity to write. I will.

Of course, if you found anything I've posted useful. Feel free to send
me an email. I love hearing feedback of any kind!

With that being said. One motto that I live by:
