## Site Updates

Some cosmetic updates to this website have occured within that past couple of
weeks that I'm proud of. I decided to move back to 
[Panr's Terminal Theme](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal). With a few
modifications though.

I have updated the theme colors which works rather well for the site.

I'm starting to warm up to utilizing images for posts. In the past; because I
wasn't a fan of images on blogs, I didn't want to use them. I felt they added to
the size of the site. Plus I'm not very good at graphic design or photography.
But, I've decided I need to work on that as an aspect of personal growth. Though
with that being said. I'm getting started with using AI generated images and
will work on the other stuff later. I feel they tie the website together and add
a little context to the page or the post. Down the road I'll probably add
contextual images for the things I'm writting about. Especially if that cant be
provided without code output. (which can be copied)

Search has been added to this website and can be found in the Nav. This is just
a page that spits all of the search results out. But, eventually I intend to
either paginate or at least limit it to 8 - 10 results at some point.
