So, it’s kind of a bitter pill to swallow. But, given my most recent discovery 
of the Hermit theme not being updated in nearly two years. I will have to turn 
away from it. It’s a wonderful theme. But I require an actively updated theme 
with a developer that will consistently fix issues related to the theme. Don’t 
get me wrong, I love the theme. Just not enough to maintain it in my spare 
time. I know full well that people have lives, and this is probably a personal 
project for them. I would like to thank them for the time they’ve put into 
creating and maintaining the Hermit theme. It’s served this blog well. If it 
were updated more regularly, I may even move back. But, for now I must move on.

One of the great things about the theme was that it was so minimal that you 
rarely had to worry about updating it unless you really need to. I may just for 
the repository should I decide I want to update it in the future.

The Hugo theme Hermit is originally developed by Track3. Below is their GitHub 
page and blog.

Below is the Repository for the Hermit Hugo theme. This has been forked 
multiple times. But it may just be time to move to something different for a 
little while. Demo is provided in the documentation of the theme if you would 
like to see it in action.

Theme has been moved from Hermit to Terminal because it’s updated regularly 
and overall, it’s an awesome theme. It keeps things minimal also. There is 
more testing that needs to be done with it. But, at this moment I have no 
problem publishing this to the site with the new theme committed.

There should be a demo provided by the author should anyone want to look at it.

So, the author of the theme gets a little more exposure. Below are their GitHub 
profiles and blog. Radek doesn’t just work on this one. He also works on others 
like the Hello Friend theme for Hugo. The link below also showcases other 
software that he’s worked on. Check it out!

If you ever need an awesome theme, I recommend checking him out! I encourage 
you to update his list of sites that are using one of these themes if you are.
