## Somthing Different

I've burnt myself out a little bit by writing primarily project and personal
SOPs for this site. So, I thought maybe I try something a little smaller.
I've been trying to read more. So, why not use this catchall journal of mine to
write about the books I read. Just something to notate finishing it outside of
Hardcover. Which I use to track books in my library. 

## The Assassins Apprentice

I really finished reading this at the end of Jan. 2026. But, I looked back at a
few points in Feb to look back at a few parts I'd thought I missed.

I finished The Assassins Apprentice by Robin Hobb. Which is the first book in
the Farseer Trilogy. You are met with Fitz who is the bastard son of the prince.
Having to navigate court life as a mere teenager with all of the uncertainty and
personalities can be difficult at times. He of course trains as an assassin on
the side with all of his other study.

I'd say the great part of Robin Hobbs writting is how well she built the world
without to much boring detail. She does a beautiful job writting the story and I
can't wait to get the second book Royal Assassin in the comming months.

This was supposed be a tandom read with The Greatest Knight: The Remarkable Life
of William Marshal, the Power Behind Five English Thrones by Thomas Asbridge. I
do intend on finishing this. But, with that comes moving on to the next tandom
read. Which I'll mention later. I use tandom reads to keep myself out of reading
slumps so I mix fiction and non-fiction together so I'm learning new things.
But, I'm still ingesting a story at other times as well.

## A Short Stay In Hell

I've been taking some time to think about this book.

Some reading updates for the month of Feb. 2026. I finished A Short Stay In Hell
by Steven L. Peck. It's a novella about a morman named Soren that wakes up in 
hell only to find out that he'd been practicing the wrong religion. This hell 
he's found himself in is a seemingly infinate library where he must ciphen out
the book that perfectly describes his life story.

Most have comapared this story to The Library of Babel. I will have to pick that
story up at some point.

I'm not sure if it was the story that captured my attention. I think it was the
relationships and the thought of what would I do in this situation. Soren
struggles with his values and the mundain aspect of eternity. I will not tell
you whether or not Soren found his book. But, I think I can say there were good
moments and there were awful moments. Although I didn't read this book blazingly
fast. I enjoyed it and I will take the story with me.

## Next In The TBR

I have some catching up to do in The Greatest Knight by Thomas Asbridge. But,
I've also started the next tandom read. Which I'll jump back and forth depending
on my mood.

This is the next bunch within the TBR I intend to ingest.

1. Dungeon Crawler Carl by Matt Dinniman
2. Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save The
   World by Joseph Menn
3. The Greatest Knight: The Remarkable Life of William Marshal, the Power Behind 
   Five English Thrones by Thomas Asbridge
