## What Have You Been Up To?

Yes. I'm alive. I've just been focusing on some things in my personal life.
Not too many problems come up that I feel I may see again. So, I haven't been
writting How-tos. Mostly just reading and being present with my family.

I tend to go through spurts of energy where I can focus on writting. But, there
is also writters block.

I have written a Go application; that isn't ready for release, that will probe
FortiGate APIs for firmware version, make, and model information. Then it will
update Netbox with that information if the platform and device type is
available. It's maturity isn't close to showing to the rest of the world. But,
for now. It does the job I need it for.

I would like to set some project goals for 2026. Just to give myself something
to shoot for within my down time that doesn't include the normal How-To or
break/fix articles. I've been interested in developing API middleware and web
applications lately. 

## Library Management System

I would like to build an LMS for myself that I can keep track of my library.
Something that will track my books and audiobooks. Along with reading goals and
books I'm currently reading. At some point. I would love to put together some
functionality that will update Goodreads and Hardcover with those updates.

## Home Area Network (HAN) Setup

Design and document my home area network over the years. I'll post the
modifications as time goes on. I cannot promise to go into to much depth. But, I
may have a separate network from my home network that I will have no problem
talking about.

## Media Server

Something I've wanted to do for a while is setup my own media server for a
while. So, I'm considering kicking the tires on Jellyfish at home within a
container environment. I'll document the process and post on this.

## HAM Radio Log

I've been interested in HAM radio lately. Considering getting my Technicians
license at some point. I like to notate call signs and conversations I listen to
between other operators when I get the chance. Thought I would develop a little
app that allows that to happen.

## Contacts App With CalDav Support

Would like to develop a contacts application that I can sync Android and iOS to
while also displaying information within the web application. There may need to
be some functionality that allows conversion if Android doesn't play well with
iOS. But, I'll cross that bridge when I get there.

## Networking Scenarios

I think I've seen enough as a network administrator to write out design and
situational scenarios for posting. One part of that I'm considering is the
implementation of those designs. I think it would be good to look back on old
designs and potential improvements on those designs. I will be covering them in
a series of posts or just one large post going from small home area networks to
large corporate networks.

## ITAM Sync Middleware For Network Gear

This is going to be a longer project. I intend to develop an application that
allows me to reach out to multiple network assets to pull data from them. This
includes devices like firewalls, routers, switches, wireless access points, etc.
This will then be able to sync to applications like Netbox or Snipe-IT or any
other application that may have an API. It will be divided into modules that can
access information for these assets using their APIs or SNMP. Maybe even SSH if
SNMP cannot give me the information I need.

## Closing Notes

I don't intend to finish all of these projects in 2026. But, I would like to at
least get a start on all of them if not finishing the first revision of two.
I'll provide some updates as time goes on with more detail when I work through
it.
