## Overview
---

This post will discuss some changes to content and the lack of content for this 
site. Some other thoughts I wanted to discuss also.

## Different content? Where have you been?

Yes. I plan on diverting from security a little and focusing more on 
infrastructure. I normally don’t make time for security related events due to 
time constraints. Hopefully, with the new year I can focus more on content that 
is related to my job function.

For Example:

- Adding posts related to what I’m working on.
- Focusing on my skill set in other areas:
- Database Administration
- Phone System Administration
- System Administration
- Network Administration
- Escaping from bad situations related to the items above.

Last year, my posts were merely non-existent. Very little content unless I 
decided to put the time and effort into working on it. Which wasn’t very often.

Currently, I’m consolidating posts and focusing on a new approach to this. One 
post for a Wargame, CTF, Vulnhub VM, etc. and I’ll update the post as I go 
through it. This will cause the content to be incomplete. But, It will work 
with my current schedule and responsibilities.

The posts that relate to SysAdmin, Network Admin, Database Admin, etc. will be 
related to my understanding of the products and technologies. I’ve wanted to 
document issues, configuration of infrastructure, etc. for a while. But, didn’t 
know what to write about. Well, in my short time of being in IT I’ve run into a 
couple weird things that others may benefit from. Think of these as a save your 
bacon post. I’ve had situations where I’ve had to save mine a couple of times.

These posts will not be tutorials. But, walk throughs of how I setup an 
application or figure out how to configure a service; e.g. DNS, MySQL, etc. 
It’s a representation of my experience within the Tech field. As I learn more 
I will setup/configure something in a different way.

You may have your own experience with an application or you’ll have questions 
as to why I did something a certain way. In fact, you will probably wonder why 
I would something like X or Y. Well, I encourage readers to discuss this with 
me. Direct message on Twitter and email is always open to these questions and 
comments. If you don’t feel shy, you can discuss this with me on the post 
through Twitter or whatever social media platform I post this on.

There are no barriers here. Whether you’re new in tech, programming, security, 
an executive, etc. I promise to explain my thought processes, why I did 
something a certain way, or provide resources that I have/will find for a topic 
of interest. I started this blog to share information. Follows the view point 
that information shouldn’t be pushed away from others because of who they are. 
Inclusion of different perspectives allows innovation to push forward or in 
another direction. You provide people, within different fields and backgrounds, 
with the information and you let them move forward from there.

Linguists have taught me things about Linux and Unix that I didn’t know about. 
Teachers develop beautiful websites. Artists build something to solve a 
problem. I’m not surprised. I’m happy about it. It provides inspiration. 
They’re utilizing their potential to learn and/or build something that may be 
out of their comfort zone. That’s something that deserves respect. Let’s see 
more of it.
