Reading is a good way for me to wind down sometimes. So I might include some of
the books I'm reading in a page at some point. But, for now. Here are the books
I'm working on right now.

- The Courage to Be Disliked: How to Free Yourself, Change your Life, and
Achieve Real Happiness by Ichiro Kishimi, Fumitake Koga
- Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World by Jack Weatherford

I'm considering doing some book reviews and notes for the books I finish reading 
within every quarter of 2025. 

Maybe I'll put a status page that has the books I'm currently reading on Goodreads.

Some of my greatest blessings are the smiles from my wife and kids.

I normally utilize TikTok for watching craftsman work on restoring shoes,
leatherworking, and cooking videos. I view more. But, still. That is what I'll
be losing and I'll have to go to YouTube.

Making some headway on a project I'm working on called dotfilesync. This is
going to be a command-line application written in Go which will sync your
dotfiles to a directory. After writting the dotfiles in a config file.
Dotfilesync will be able to either backup, deploy, or sync your dotfiles.
Another handy feature I intend to add to this is to make it so it can perform
the Git operations as well.

For now it ignores .git directories. But, at somepoint. I intend on developing
it in such a manner that dotfilesync will be able to recognize a git repo and
set it up in the .dotfiles sync directory. But, for now. It's just best to
ignore it. It's already going to save me time in the future with the backup,
deploy, and sync functionality alone.
