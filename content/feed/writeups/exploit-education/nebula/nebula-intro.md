## Summary
---

Welcome to my write up for the Exploit-Exercises - Nebula wargame. I will begin this write up with some information from the wargame. If you would like to play this wargame, you can follow the links to download the VM.

- [Exploit Eduation - Nebula](https://exploit.education/nebula/)

In this writeup, I will be going through the levels in order. I will explain the solution to each level as clearly as possible. Just note, that this write up may not be complete. I will be editing it in chunks.

The level introductions needed to be pulled using Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. At the time of writing this, it looks like the Exploit-Exercises website is offline.

## About
---

Nebula takes the participant through a variety of common (and less than common) weaknesses and vulnerabilities in Linux. It looks at

- SUID files
- Permissions
- Race conditions
- Shell meta-variables
- $PATH weaknesses
- Scripting language weaknesses
- Binary compilation failures

At the end of Nebula, the user will have a reasonably thorough understanding of local attacks against Linux systems, and a cursory look at some of the remote attacks that are possible.
Levels

Have a look at the levels available on the side bar, and log into the virtual machine as the username “levelXX” with a password of “levelXX” (without quotes), where XX is the level number.

Some levels can be done purely remotely.

## Getting root
---

In case you need root access to change stuff (such as key mappings, etc), you can do the following:

Log in as the “nebula” user account with the password “nebula” (both without quotes), followed by “sudo -s” with the password “nebula”. You’ll then have root privileges to change whatever needs to be changed.

Below is the list of levels completed for Exploit Education: Nebula.
