# Notes

For lack of a better phrase. Notes are my life blood in most cases. They're 
useful reference points for my day to day work and can aid me in making 
decisions for different aspects of life. Sometimes these notes are very specific 
or generalized topic wise. (e.g. updating router configuration or notes taken 
from an article)

If I've had to search something multiple times. It will find its way into my
notes.
