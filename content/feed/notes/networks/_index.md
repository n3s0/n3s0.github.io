This is a space where I provide snipits of designs I develop or see used
commonly throughout my career. I like to look back on the things I've built or
maintained. I also like to have a point of reference available in case I need to
explain something or reference different design concepts.

Plus, if I see a design in here that may work for someone. I have the foundation
for it available. Just add a little customization and there we go. We have a
network.

Although the designs may be similar to many organization or residential networks.
