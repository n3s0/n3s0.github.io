Picked a good time to deploy a new website to Github Pages. At this
time Github is experiencing service degredation on their Actions and
Pages as of 21:31 UTC. So, if you start seeing weird it's probably 
because there is in fact some weird.

Github status page is listed below for anyone that wants to follow
along.

Last I checked it was just Actions that was having problems. Kind of
defeats the purpose to report this on something hosted on Github Pages.
But... suprise. If this gets to anyone.

ChatGPT has a bad reputation. But, it can be useful should you need 
project ideas. In the grand scheme of things you can utilize it to 
simulate developer / customer interaction. It tells you what it expects.
Which is nice if you're ever in a slump and need to pad that portfolio.
