Picked a good time to deploy a new website to Github Pages. At this
time Github is experiencing service degredation on their Actions and
Pages as of 21:31 UTC. So, if you start seeing weird it's probably 
because there is in fact some weird.

Github status page is listed below for anyone that wants to follow
along.

Last I checked it was just Actions that was having problems. Kind of
defeats the purpose to report this on something hosted on Github Pages.
But... suprise. If this gets to anyone.
