Good to know that my [OpenBSD wirguard server setup](/notes/20221203170137/) article is working as 
expected still. I did a speed run of it and I didn't run into any hiccups for 
it. So, that's a plus. I dicided to move some stuff around. It seems more 
efficient to generate he keys first and then complete the setup.
