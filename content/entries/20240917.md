With Hugo if you utilize the static directory it will load fonts and 
CSS locally. But, it won't load it when it's uploaded to GitHub pages.
Something for me to investigate.

Looks like my issue with Hugo was the theme.css file for this site had
multiple entries in the font-family field. Causing the css file to fail
during the build. I'll need to be more careful about that.
