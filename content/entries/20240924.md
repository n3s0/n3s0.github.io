Not sure if I've talked about this site before. But, this is wonderful for
wireless troubleshooting. Name is Wigle.net and it's used to importing 
war driving data and making it available to the public. Which isn't a bad
think.

- [wigle.net](https://wigle.net/)

With that being said there is a lot of information on this site. So, I'm
considering integrating with it's API for tool that will help with various
troubleshooting. It can be useful to see if there is an available BSSID
in an area or check the OUI for the BSSID to see what vendor it's for. SSID
names are generally set to defaults and those defaults have a tendancy of
providing vendor data for a wirless network. Plus, an exact location is
useful as well.

Enough rambling. There is is.

Learned a little bit about the Fortinet equivalent of hello/dead intervals
for BFD are transmit/detechtion intervals. Bidirectional Forwarding Detection
(BFD) is used to detect faults between two routers connected by a link.

- [Technical Tip: How FortiGate calculates BFD timers (Transmit Interval, Detection Time)](https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-How-FortiGate-calculates-BFD-timers-Transmit/ta-p/277601)

Maybe this will be useful in the future. It's useful for failover that's for 
sure.
