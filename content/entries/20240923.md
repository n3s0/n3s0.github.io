Learned a little bit about Roku devices and TVs today. More then I care
to. I never knew this until today after some troubleshooting that made
me a little confused. But, I understand the design. I just wish it was 
done a little differently.

When Roku devices after the Roku 3; I believe, are powered up and connect 
to the wireless. It creates another wireless network so Roku remotes can
connect to it. This is great and all but, it causes interference on the
wireless network it connects to because it mimics the wireless channel it's
on. When you do this with one access point and three Roku TVs it can cause
problems. Enough to break things.

Here is a KB article for reference on issues occuring at a university
and their recommendations.

- [University of SD:  How to Disable Wi-Fi Direct on Roku Devices](https://td.usd.edu/TDClient/33/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=5519)

Mine was different. Move it to a different wireless network. Though the 
University of South Dakota has the right idea. Given that if you had
multiple Rokus in the same dorm exibiting the same behavior. It can cause
a lot of interferance. Rant over. But, I may talk more about wireless
later if that starts to become my niche in troubleshooting. Just references
and what not. Nothing to exciting.
