## Summary
---

Just ran into an issue with deploying the Docker container for Nautobot on
Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Kept outputing the docker help everytime I would run invoke.

## Solution
---

The solution was to edit the invoke task for invoke.py and set it to
docker-compose and not docker compose.

Needed to change the docker_compose function so the compose command was
docker-compose and not docker compose. after the update Invoke would run the
command with no issue.
