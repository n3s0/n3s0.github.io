In another post I went over how to create an address group in FortiOS
using the CLI. Now I'm going to go through adding or appending antoher
address to an address group.

I mentioned this in the previous post. But, before you add more address
group members. The address you're adding needs to be created.

First I'll look at the lab servers address group configuration so I know
the current configuration. This is a good way to make sure you're not
replicating any previous work.

```sh
show firewall addrgrp "lab servers"
```

Below is the output of the command above. As shown there are two members
in the address group.

```sh
config firewall addrgrp
    edit "lab servers"
        set uuid af519380-2094-51e9-391c-b78e8edbddfc
        set member "tl-db-01" "tl-app-01"
    next
end
```

Go into the addrgrp configuration prompt by typing in the following
command.

```sh
config firewall addrgrp
```

Edit the "lab servers" address group using the following command.

```sh
edit "lab servers"
```

The following command will append the new server tl-app-02 to the list
of members in the lab servers address group. Make sure when this is
finihsed. Enter the "next" and "end" commands.

```sh
append member "tl-app-02"
```

After checking the configuration again. The new configuration includes
the new server in the members list.

```sh
config firewall addrgrp
    edit "lab servers"
        set uuid af519380-2094-51e9-391c-b78e8edbddfc
        set member "tl-db-01" "tl-app-01" "tl-app-02"
    next
end
```
