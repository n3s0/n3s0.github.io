## Overview
---

This article is a brief article on adding Calendars to Microsoft Outlook. 
This scenario is generally after you've been granted permission to a 
users Calendar folder.

## Process
---

Below is the process for adding a shared calendar to Outlook. You will 
need to know the name of the shared calendar before you proceed and confirm 
that permissions have been assigned.

1. Open Microsoft Outlook.
2. Click on the Calendar tab in the lower left-hand corner of the 
   application.
3. In the Home tab at the top of the application, click on "Open Calendar".
4. Click on Open Shared Calendar...
5. You can do two things from the "Open a Shared Calendar" form.
  - Type the email address of the shared calendar. Click OK.
  - Search for the calendar using the "Name..." button. This will open 
    the Global Address List (GAL) so you can search through the users. 
    Once you select the approprate user, click OK.

## Conclusion

The newly added Shared Calendar will now be in the "Shared Calendars" 
category. Just check the box and you'll see it. If there are any questions, 
please let me know.
