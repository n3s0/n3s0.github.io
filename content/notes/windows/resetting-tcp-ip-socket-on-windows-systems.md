## Summary

This post contains notes for resetting the TCP/IP and WinSock stacks on
Windows Systems. Doing so can generally be a good troubleshooting step
when you're having issues with network connectivity and network
interfaces.

The need for this can stem from a corrupt or misconfigured TCP/IP or
WinSock stack.

Before performing the commands in this article. An Administrator CMD or
PowerShell prompt will need to be opened. 

## Reasons For This

There are some valid reasons for needing to do this.

- Post Malware removal.
- DNS lookup issues. (Sort of.)
- Limited or no connectivity errors.
- If network connectivity keeps dropping on the workstation. But, seems
  to keep working on every other workstation on the network. Though, do
  make sure to check for other issues.
- BSOD messages that indicate an issue with the tcpip.sys driver.

If I run into something and remember about this post. I'll provide an
update to an issue that's performing this operation has fixed.

## Resetting WinSock

This command will reset the Winsock Catalog. 

Winsock Catalog registry path is below.

- HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinSock2\Parameters\Protocol_Catalog9

Performing the command below will return the Winsock Catalog to a clean
stated. Uninstalling all Winsock Layered Service Providers.

```powershell
netsh winsock reset
```

## Resetting TCP/IP

Generally used when you're having network connectivity issues.

The following command will rewrite the registry keys below. I'll provide
more data later on this.

- SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\ 
- SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DHCP\Parameters\ 

```powershell
netsh interface ip reset
```

## Release, Renew, and Flushdns

One good thing to do after you reset the WinSock and TCP/IP Stacks on
Windows boxes is reset the IP address configuration in DHCP. This is
only if it's configured of course. If you have a static configuration.
You should just be able to reboot.

I have another article for this. That I'm showing below.

- [Windows: Release/Renew DHCP and Flush DNS Using CLI/PowerShell](https://info.n3s0.tech/2022/07/01/20220701101438)

## Conclusion

After you've gone through this article. Reboot your workstation so the
changes apply properly.
