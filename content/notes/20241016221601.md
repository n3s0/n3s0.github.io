## Summary
---

Recently I've been thinking about moving to Arch Linux. I do this thing where
I move from OS to OS. But, I don't document my setup for it or how I get through
the setup. Which would probably save me from looking for a reference on the
Internet later.

These are my notes for installing Arch Linux as a workstation. I will go through
performing the following steps, start to finish, with the commands used and 
some explaination as to why I install it that way.
