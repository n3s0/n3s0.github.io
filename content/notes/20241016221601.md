## Summary
---

Recently I've been thinking about moving to Arch Linux. I do this thing where
I move from OS to OS. But, I don't document my setup for it or how I get through
the setup. Which would probably save me from looking for a reference on the
Internet later.

These are my notes for installing Arch Linux as a workstation. I will go through
performing the following steps, start to finish, with the commands used and 
some explaination as to why I install it that way.

## Installing Arch Linux
---

Will be installing this in EFI mode. So, I'll need to check to make sure the EFI
directory has files in it.

```sh
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/
```

```sh
ip link
```

```sh
ip addr
```

```sh
ping 1.1.1.1
```

If everything is good. Continue.

Check for the disk.

```sh
fdisk -l
```

```sh
Disk /dev/sda: 30 GiB, 32212254720 bytes, 62914560 sectors
Disk model: VBOX HARDDISK
Units: sectors or 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 btyes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/option): 512 bytles / 512 bytes
```


```sh
fdisk /dev/sda
```

```sh
Command (m for help): g
Created a new GPT disklabel (GUID: AE7700B3-1091-4F26-95FC-AEB7C37EC90).
```
