I've been using an EliteBook 840 G5 as my daily driver for about two
or three years now. Though, I've installed OpenBSD a handful of times as
my main OS. I've never actually documented it. Figured I'd go through
this a little bit.

Not going to go through a tear down for this post. Just going to list
the hardware for the laptop and discuss the firmware for it.

Provided will be a log of the installation and support. Support meaning
If there is an issue. I figure out how to fix it and provide the issue,
troubleshooting, and the solution. If I find one.

Lastly, there will be the Support Summary or table of everything working
in OpenBSD -current.
