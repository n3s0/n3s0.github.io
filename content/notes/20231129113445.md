## Summary
---

I’ve been doing some poking around with Veeam Backup & Replication PowerShell 
modules lately. I wrote a quick and dirty script that will allow me to email 
the license usage to myself when I need it.

The idea behind this is to place it on each Veeam Backup & Replication 
instance with a scheduled task that will run ever so often. As time goes 
on I’ll improve this. But, it beats spending money on the Veeam Service 
Provider Console. If you’re required to report your licensing to Veeam. 
Either this or VSPC is useful.

In the next section I’ll go through the script and explain what it does.

## Script
---

This script assumes you have an open relay available to send the email.

It Will provide a detailed report of the current licensing usage at that
point in time. This includes all of the points used up from the license
for the servers, workstations, Veeam Agents, etc. that are being backed 
up.

```powershell
# Reporting Configuration
$ReportHost = $(Get-ComputerInfo -Property CsDNSHostName).CsDNSHostName
$ReportPath = ""
$ReportFile = "$(Get-Date -UFormat %Y-%m-%d) - $ReportHost - VBR License Report"
$ReportType = "html"
$FullReportPath = "$ReportPath$ReportFile.$ReportType"
# SMTP Configuration
$ToAddress = ""
$FromAddress = ""
$SMTPServer = ""
$SMTPPort = ""

If ((Get-ChildItem -Path $ReportPath -Force | Measure-Object).Count -eq 0) 
{
    Generate-VBRLicenseUsageReport -Path "$ReportPath$ReportFile" -Type $ReportType
    $ReportBody = $(Get-Content -Path $FullReportPath -Raw)
    Send-MailMessage -From $FromAddress -To $ToAddress -Subject $ReportFile -SmtpServer $SMTPServer -Port $SMTPPort -BodyAsHtml -Body $ReportBody
    Remove-Item -Path $FullReportPath
} Else {
    Send-MailMessage -From $FromAddress -To $ToAddress -Subject $ReportFile -SmtpServer $SMTPServer -Port $SMTPPort -BodyAsHtml -Body $ReportBody
    Remove-Item -Path $FullReportPath
}
```
