## Overview

These are some notes from some fun I had while installing and configuring 
Jekyll on OpenBSD 7.0-current. The installation wasn't bad. I just want 
to document for future use.

I use Jekyll for building static sites that are hosted on and off the 
Internet. The best part about it is it's useful and it's free. Some themes 
you have to pay for. Others you don't have to pay a dime to use. They're 
the low low cost of free.

Included is a link to the Jekyll website in case it sparks interest with 
anyone reading this.

There are a couple of components involved with installing Jekyll. Such 
as Ruby. Though, I have notes on installing Ruby on OpenBSD 7.0-Current 
also. I will cover that in the section where I talk about installing Ruby. 
Luckily, Ruby is the only thing that needs to be installed and configured 
for the time being.

## Dependencies

Like I mentioned, the only dependency for Jekyll that I've seen so far 
is Ruby. I haven't come accross anything else that I may need to install. 
Other than the Ruby Gems after the fact.

- Ruby >= 3.0

## Installing Ruby

Installing Ruby isn't too difficult on OpenBSD. As long as you read the 
documentation after installing it, it's a pretty seemless process. I have 
another page specifically for installing Ruby at the link below. This is 
required before Jekyll is installed.

- [OpenBSD 7.0 - Installing Ruby 3.0](/posts/20211217002326/)

Once Ruby gets installed, I can start with the installation of Jekyll. I 
will go over that in the next section.

## Installing Jekyll 

Installing Jekyll is pretty simple. It's a Ruby gem that gets installed 
and goes into the path ```$HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin```. There are some 
steps associated with it before it works the way you want it though.

The following will install the needed components for Jekyll and Bundler. 
Bundler is used as a gem management tool used to provide all of the needed 
gems/libraries so Jekyll can run the say it should.

```sh
gem install --user jekyll jekyll-feed jekyll-seo-tag minima bundler
```

Now it's time to configure symbolic links for all of the gems. This can 
be done using the ln(1) command. This will set the name to it's originally 
respective name. As opposed to e.g. jekyll30.

```sh
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/jekyll30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/jekyll
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/bundler30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/bundler
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/bundle30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/bundle
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/kramdown30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/kramdown
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/listen30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/listen
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/rougify30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/rougify
ln -sf $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/safe_yaml30 $HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/bin/safe_yaml
```

Now it's time to add the BUNDLE_PATH variable to the shell. This can 
also be added to the rc file for the shell being used. In my case, I added 
it to the ```.zshrc``` file. without it, gems may not install.

```sh
export BUNDLE_PATH=$HOME/.gem/ruby/3.0/gems
```

Now that Jekyll is installed, it's time to build a new site and test.

## Get Started Using Jekyll

First, the directory for the site needs to be created. This can be done 
by using the mkdir(1) command. This will create a new directory named 
```myblog``` that the site will go into.

```sh
mkdir myblog
```
Build the new blog using the ```jekyll``` command in the myblog directory.

```sh
jekyll new myblog
```

Below is the output from generating the new blog. This will scaffold 
everything needed to serve a new blog locally on the computer.

```sh

  Bundler: Bundled gems are installed into `/home/example/.gems/ruby/3.0/gems`
New jekyll site installed in /home/example/testing/myblog.
```

Change directories into the ```myblog``` directory.

```sh
cd myblog
```

Run the Jekyll site. Though, this may fail. The Webrick library is 
required in the Jekyll project Gemfile so the server can run. Webrick 
in essance is the http or https server library that acts as a dependency. 
It's noted in Jekyll's official documentation that it's a dependancy of 
Jekyll. 

It isn't needed when you install Jekyll on Ruby 2. But, it is when you 
do with Ruby 3. May be worth noting that I included this as a "Troubleshooting 
Tip" in the link found in resources.

```sh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Suspected output can be found below.

```sh
Configuration file: /home/example/testing/myblog/_config.yml
            Source: /home/example/testing/myblog
