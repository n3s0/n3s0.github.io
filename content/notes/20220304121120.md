## Overview

Decided to give Sway another try. It's certainly been a while. Sway is
intended to be a replacement for the X11 window manager i3wm. It's just
the Wayland version.

When I tried it when I did. I didn't quite mind it. Only gripe I really
had was how the graphics performed and that it was noticeably different
as far as i3wm was concerned.

Here I will provide a repo for my configuration files for my Sway
environment on Fedora. I will also go over my process for installation
and configuration. Troubleshooting hurtles I go through will be
documented and discussed.

Expect regular updates to this article.

## Installation

Installation on Fedora is pretty simple. Just  the package manager to 
install Sway.

```sh
dnf install -y sway
```

This will install the following packages and dependencies. These
dependencies could change at any time. So take the output with a grain
of salt, please.

Note that your output may not be the same as mine.

Then it's time to copy over the default configuration for Sway. Did this
using the following commands.

Created the sway directory in the .config directory.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/sway
```

Copy over the default configuration file.

```sh
cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway/
```

Once that was done. I rebooted and login to my account using the Sway
Window Manager within GDM. Note that this is done using the gear in the
lower right-hand corner at the password portion of the login screen.

This will login to Sway. If anyone would like to learn more about Sway.

article.

## Configuration

This is the section where I cover some of my configuration for Sway. Not
going to go into all of the details for it. That can be done by going to
the git repository for the configuration.

I'll explain some interesting things I found throughout the process of
configuring this.

### Status Bar

One of the great things about i3 Window Manager was the status bar.
i3status is absolutely wonderful. Though, on sway you don't use this.

Waybar has been what I've stuck with. Although, it completely covers up
dmenu. I've found another suitable alternative for that also. Which I
will provide in the next section.

Actual configuration notes will be provided in due time.

### Dmenu Alternative - wofi

Although, the online documentation seems unkept. It's man pages are well
written. Chose this as a "native" alternative to dmenu and rofi. It's
supposed to be the Wayland Rofi after all.

I'll provide more documentation on the configuration as I have it. I'm
still working on making this better in order to suit my needs.

## Other Notes & Opinions

### 05/25/2022

So far it's been about two months since I've switched to Swaywm on
Fedora 35 and I don't have any complaints. Sure, there is a learning
curve to Wayland applications. But, nothing that reading the man pages
can't fix with time. So far I haven't had any issues with screen tearing
or anything like that.

Decided for the status bar. I would go with Waybar. I like the way it
looks. It also provides all the data I need or want so far in a status
bar.

I moved over from dmenu to wofi because in dmenu you're unable to see
the output if Waybar is at the top. Which is my prefrence. So instead of
figuring out a way to fix that. I decided to add another alternative to
the environment.
