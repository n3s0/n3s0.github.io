Wanted to briefly write a note for updating the NTP server on a Cisco
switch. This is generally good if moving to on premise NTP servers is
something I'd like to do someday.

Currently this is the configuration for the NTP server in the
configuration.

```
!
ntp server 192.168.0.200
!
```

Login to the switch and go into the configuration prompt.

```sh
configure terminal
```

Remove the NTP server configuration from the switch. In this case it's
pointing to the IP address 192.168.0.200. This will need to be removed
so the switch doesn't have any old configuration.

```sh
no ntp server 192.168.0.200
```

Then configure the NTP server to point to the new one.

```sh
ntp server 192.168.1.200
```

One good way to know that this works is by checking the NTP associations using
the appropriate show command.

```sh
show ntp associations
```

Below we should see the available configuration and the delay of the
time server. If there is a ref clock available and the time is correct.
There is a good chance the time is synced.

```sh

  address           ref clock        st   when   poll reach  delay offset  disp
*~192.168.1.200     10.50.38.170     2    973   1024   377  0.846   0.624 0.050
 * sys.peer, # selected, + candidate, - outlyer, x falseticker, ~configured
```

Another method to test is using the show ntp status command. This will
for sure tell you if the clock is synced.

```sh
show ntp status
```
