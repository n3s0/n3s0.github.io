## Summary
---

Recently I came across an issue where someone needed to add their Sticky Notes to their new computer and I learned how. Sticky notes are still used pretty frequently and with the volume of sticky notes they had. They weren’t about to copy and paste them.

## Process
---

This process was performed on Windows 10 22H2.

Sticky notes are located in the following path. We can go to these paths in File Explorer or a command terminal on the Windows device.

```powershell
%UserProfile%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
```

or

```powershell
C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState
```

The migration wasn’t difficult. I just copied the contents of the LocalState directory to the other computer in the same file path. Worked like a charm.

One thing that I ran into with this was an article mentioned that if you just move the plum.sqlite file. This will do the trick. It looks like you need to copy the contents of the whole directory or move the database files named plum.sqlite, plum.sqlite-shm, and plum.asqlite-wal.

These files can be copied using the Admin share on the local computer or using a flash drive. Once moved the user should have all of the sticky notes on the other computer. I may consider adding this to my migration process. Looks like people use them more then I originally thought.
