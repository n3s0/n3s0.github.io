```sh
diagnose hardware sysinfo memory
```

```sh
diagnose system top
```

This command will list the crashlogs for the FortiGate firewall. This
can be useful when you 

```sh
diagnose debug crashlog read
```

Another command that support requests output for. Though this will
provide encrypted output of the crashlog. Usually best to use the 
command above. Unless you prefer to send the data provided in the 
output of this command. 

```sh
diagnose debug crashlog get
```
