## Overview

This article provides a Cmdlets for exporting a mailbox for an 
Exchange server. It also provides Cmdlets for viewing export requests. 
This can be useful in a number of ways. Say that you want to keep/archive 
mail of a user that has left the company. This is a good way to keep 
the data just in case there's a need for it.

Note that in order to export to a file share, you will first need a file 
share. The Exchange Trusted Subsystem security group will need permissions 
to the shared folder you'll be exporting to. These permissions include Read 
for imports, Read/Write for exports.

## PowerShell

This Cmdlet will export the mailbox of the USERNAME to the file path of 
whatever you replace FILEPATH with. This could be the path of a network 
share or locally where the PST file is going.

```powershell
New-MailboxExportRequest -Mailbox USERNAME -FilePath \\FILE\PATH.pst
```

The Cmdlet below will list all of the Mailbox Export Requests that are 
in progress, completed, or error out.

```powershell
Get-MailboxExportRequest
```

If you would like to remove all mailbox export requests, you can use the 
following Cmdlet. This will obtain a list of all export requests and 
remove them. You will be prompted to confirm that you would like to do this.

```powershell
Get-MailboxExportRequest | Remove-MailboxExportRequest
```
