Providing some notes for submitting data to HPE using the supportsave
command. Sometimes when you have issues with their Brocade Fiber Channel
switches. If that's failed hardware or SFPs they may have you utilize
this command to submit logs and data to help them troubleshoot.

This could change as time goes on. But, they host FTP and HTTP servers
for submitting this data. The supportsave command will collect the data
needed and send it to whatever IP address you send to. But, to make
things easier. With an open support case they'll provide the credentials
for sending the information.

Below is the prompt that shows after SSH login.

```sh
lab-fcsw-01:admin>
```

Enter the following command into the prompt.

```sh
supportsave
```

Follow a similar process as follows. This will pull all of the necessary
information support needs. One thing to note is if HPE provided credentials
to a SFTP or SSH server to push the files to. That server can be used.

If your environent is extensively filtered on your network management 
VLAN. Allowing traffic to this may be useful. If this is too much work.
Just upload to a local server, pull the data via scp/sftp, and then 
provide the information to support. 

```sh
This command collects RASLOG, TRACE, supportShow, core file, FFDC data
and then transfer them to a FTP/SCP/SFTP server or a USB device.
This operation can take several minutes.
NOTE: supportSave will transfer existing trace dump file first, then
automatically generate and transfer latest one. There will be two trace dump
files transferred after this command.

All of this will provide a metric ton of log files and data to look
through. Generally this data will be submitted to support from the
command.

Sometimes a different port or protocol is required. These can be
specified. Though, one thing to take away from this is also. Packet
filtering of any kind will need to allow the port outbound.
