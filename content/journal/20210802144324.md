Over the course of the next few weeks or so I will be adding categories 
to Favlinks, link below. This will be in the section that is named 
```Red Team & Blue Team Fun```.

Amongst other link categories, there will be one that will be dedicated 
to things like CTFs, Wargames, & Hacking challenges. Sometimes people 
like to get started with a particular project in mind. Some lose all their 
links to the death of their computer. This happens. It's a fact of life.

So, should anyone find themselves a link that isn't in this list. Let me 
know and I'll add it. The Favlinks page is there to provide resources 
for everyone. Some will be ones that I frequent the most. Others will be 
there just in case someone on the Internet needs a link to something in 
that category.

Hopefully it's helpful to most that visit the page.
