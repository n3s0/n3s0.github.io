So, last night I completed a large chunk of this site. With that and 
some CSS updates to it. I'm pretty happy about it. It's starting to all
come together. I have more ideas on what to do. But, for now I'm going
to look at the current progress as a win.

I would seem as though I've been living under a rock. I just learned
about ISC's Kea DHCP server today and that the end of life date for
ISC DHCP was in January 2022. So, I'm about four years behind knowing.
Granted, EOL just means that it's reached the end of its code being
maintained.

Here is a link to the article from ISC.

- [ISC DHCP Server has reached EOL](https://www.isc.org/blogs/isc-dhcp-eol/)

Looks like Kea DHCP has been in the works since 2015 in an effort
to develop a newer codebase. Considering how mature the codebase is for
ISC DHCP. Which I'm not mad about. Considering I've been reading about
Kea DHCP having an API. I'm curious about if it will integrate with
either Unbound, Knot, or NSD for DDNS.

I think one of the bigger appeals for Kea is the DHCPv6 stuff for others.
Granted, I haven't really worked on integrating IPv6 in most of the
corporate environments that I've worked in. Mostly because there isn't a
need for it. Famous last words. I know.

Here is a link to the article regarding Kea DHCP.

- [Kea DHCP](https://www.isc.org/kea/)

Here is a link to the documentation. (For notes...)

- [Kea DHCP Administrator Reference Manual](https://kea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

While I'm at it. I might as well pull the documentation for Unbound,
Knot, and NSD. Shown below. 

Unbound links are below.

- [NLnet Labs: Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/)
- [NLnet Labs: Unbound Documentation : latest](https://unbound.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/)

NSD links are below.

- [NLnet Labs: Name Server Daemon (NSD)](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd/about/)
- [NLnet Labs: NSD Documentation : latest](https://nsd.docs.nlnetlabs.nl/en/latest/)

Below are the links for Knot DNS.

- [Knot DNS](https://www.knot-dns.cz/)
- [Knot DNS Documentation (3.4)](https://www.knot-dns.cz/docs/3.4/html/index.html)

One thing that I would like to note is that Knot has a DNS resolver too.
It's called Knot Resolver. However I'm more familiar with the products 
that come out of NLnet Labs. I've deployed them for personal reasons a
few times and it works pretty well. I've also seen Unbound work well in
production for multiple environments. At some point I will work though 
deploying a Knot DNS server.
