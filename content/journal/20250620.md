## Learned About RFC6598
---

Notating [RFC 6598](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) or
Carrier-grade NAT (CGN or CGNAT); which is used by ISPs as a private network 
for their customer equiptment (CPE). Not to confuse this with 
[RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918). RFC 6598 is 
a /10 subnet the carrier can use to manage their customer routers. Although 
[RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6598) address space can be 
used for CGN networks. It's not best practice.

Best practice is to utilize the following address space or the like.

- 100.64.0.0/10

For more reading on the subject; and for future reference. I'm including a few
links to the CGN RFC.

- [RFC 6888](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6888)
- [RFC 6898](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6898)

I might make a notes article for the concept and what RFCs cover it. These can
be boring documents for most people. So, the gist of it may be helpful. Some of
the smartest people I have peers who've read the RFC(s) for a concept a couple 
of times so they have a baseline of the concept. Others take the approach of
learning from the vendors who develop software implementing the protocol. 
Software vendor implementation can differ. But, at the end of the day. If you're
fixing the issue. That's what matters.

## What About RFC1918?
---

Given that I mentioned [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6888). 
It might be a good time to discuss it a little. It's probably the first thing 
anyone in IT or within the general public should learn if they expect to 
troubleshoot private networks.

- [RFC 1918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1918)

I will also put together some notes for this and post it in the future.

## Some Thoughts On How To Think About IPv6
---

I have come to realize that I need to not think about IPv6 networking with an
IPv4 brain. The concepts with IPv6 are completely different. I've been working
with IPv4 all my life. I default to it for everything because it works well.
But, I think the next capter is to start thinking about both. Not to mention,
think a bigger about how it all works. No pun intended.
