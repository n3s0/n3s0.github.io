First journal entry for the new year. It's been a few months since I've had
anything to add personally. Life has been pretty crazy with a newborn that I
sort of put this notes blog down for a little while. Though in the process; when
I had down time, I created some fun tools that I'm a pretty big fan of. Might
even provide a little more information about them in their own separate
articles.

I wrote a command line application that will obtian the notBefore and notAfter
values from within a TLS certificate and run a test on the current tiem of the
machine it's running in. Along with the timezone that the machine is running in.
The name of the application is called certchecker and I wrote this in Go so I
could have a quick ad-hoc way of pulling this information. At some point. I may
add more functionality. I will because I would like to automate the process a
little more as far as alerting is concerned. Perhaps even add some alerting from
a daemon process that will provide a weekly to monthly report for a list of
certificates.

Below is the Git repository for it if anyone is interested.

I am convinced that Google Cloud Platform training is some of the best that I've
taken in a long time. They provide just about enough hands-on material with
lecture that makes it almost perfect. Given the hands-on lab material it
provides outside of the courses. That makes up for it. Some of the courses are
all just hands-on labs too. It's great!

Finished finally setting up my first VPN tunnel between a FortiGate firewall and
Google Cloud Platform. Given that there isn't a whole lot of data related to the
subject online. I thing I'm going to write some notes for it. Stay tuned for
more... I intend on jotting down my notes for that and GCP to GCP VPN tunnels.
