I would like to note that I have finished quite a few courses in Google Cloud
Platform. I'm starting to get the hang of things. So, I'm thinking about posting
more notes on how to perform different tasks using the gcloud shell and
Terraform.

Perhaps I should have a page where I say, "Behold. My stuff.", filled with the
badges I earn from different training. Perhaps I'll call it the training log.
Filled with completed courses with my thoughts about those courses. Along with
different certifications and badges I earn throughout the years.

Just posted a few articles on Fortinet interface statistics and how to see,
clear, and restore them through the commandline.
