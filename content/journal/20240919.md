I recently got to thinking about there being a potential need to track
any bulk shipments for any packages I have shipped out. With that being
said. I did just find out that UPS has an API that can be queried. So,
I'm considering integrating with it somehow so I don't have to search for
them in Google one by one or every time.

- [UPS Track Alert API](https://developer.ups.com/api/reference?loc=en_US&api=trackalert)

Based on the information I've looked into. You need to request this with
UPS specifically and they'll generate an API key and send it to you upon
approval.

It looks like USPS also has a Web Tools API Library that can be used to
track packages. I've provided the link below. This is after signing up 
of course/

- [USPS & Web Tools APIs](https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/)

There is a "legacy" one available. Which I may look into later.

Found a new cell provider out in the wild. So I thought I'd just 
document it. Spent a little time looking into them and I'm not 
really sure I'd try them out. Even though it looks like they have
good coverage based on their website.

Name of the phone provider is Viaero Wireless. Below is their peering 
information from PeeringDB. Kind of lookks like their actual company
name is NE COLORODO CELLULAR.

Below is their website if anyone is interested in utilizing them.

- [Viaero Wireless](http://www.viaero.com/)

I probably wont use them. But, who knows. Other's may be looking for
another cell provider. Dual SIMs anyone? *wink* *wink*
