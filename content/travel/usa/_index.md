# USA

Where you can show someone a picture of a Bald Eagle or an american flag and
they'll think, "Hell yeah...", in their head.

The United States is a large, diverse country in North America with a population 
of over 330 million people, a federal republic of 50 states, and a global 
economic and military power. It is known for its vast and varied geography, 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts, with diverse cultures shaped by waves 
of immigration, a rich history dating back to Native American civilizations, 
and a significant role in global popular culture.
